<h1>Alice's Report for Project 2</h1>

<p>1. My idea for this project was to make a sort of random generator that
    would take in two lists of words and randomly pair one word from each list 
    with another from the other list. The purpose of this generator would be 
    a sort of challenge for artists, to randomly generate two words and have to 
    use both in whatever art form they prefer. 
</p>
<p>2. Currently, the database only holds
    two tables, one for each list. And each row in the table has the name of the 
    item and its id. I think that I could add more data to each item to make the 
    generator a bit more robust, but this is all I have so far. I am having trouble 
    figuring out how to randomly choose a word from each table, so potentially adding 
    another parameter would help with this issue.
</p>
<p>3. I have an express-based web service for interacting with the database</p>
<p>4. My web service is available via hhtps://project2.alice347.me:8443/</p>
<p>5. the endpoints of the service as well as its parameters are appropriately named</p>
<p>6. The web service sends and receives complex data as JSON</p>
<p>7. The full spectrum of CRUD operations are supported</p>
<p>8. The database is only directly accessible from within my droplet</p>
<p>9. I created an Nginx server that allows global, encrypted access to your web service</p>
<p>10. The webservice has an options wildcard endpoint</p>
<p>11. My project has been started using a pm2</p>
<p>12. My service is stored in a Git repository and has been shared</p>
<p>13. My database's creation and schema scripts are included in my repository</p>
<p>14. My git has a steady flow of commits</p>
<p>15. If you are seeing this, then I have sucessfully gotten my report html published properly</p>

<h2>Endpoints</h2>
<p>Posting: </p>
<p>/first_list and /second_list</p>
<p>In the example curl function below, you would send in data as "item" and then the word you'd like to add to the list</p>
<p>// curl --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"item" : "bird"}' http://localhost:5001/first_list</p>
<p>Get: </p>
<p>/first_list prints all of the items in the first list</p>
<p>/second_list prints all of the items in the second list</p>
<p>/first_list/:id prints the item from the first list with the specified id</p>
<p>/second_list/:id prints the item from the second list with the specified id</p>
<p>Patch:</p>
<p>/first_list/:id updates the spelling of a item in the first list with the specified id</p>
<p>/second_list/:id updates the spelling of a item in the second list with the specified id</p>
<p>Delete:</p>
<p>/first_list/:id deletes the item with the specified id</p>
<p>/second_list/:id deletes the item with the specified id</p>
