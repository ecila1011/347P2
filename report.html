<h1>Alice's Report for Project 2</h1>

<p>1. My idea for this project was to make a sort of random generator that
    would take in two lists of words and randomly pair one word from each list 
    with another from the other list. The purpose of this generator would be 
    a sort of challenge for artists, to randomly generate two words and have to 
    use both in whatever art form they prefer. Currently, the database only holds
    two tables, one for each list. And each row in the table has the name of the 
    item and its id. I think that I could add more data to each item to make the 
    generator a bit more robust, but this is all I have so far.
